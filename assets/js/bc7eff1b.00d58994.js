Introduction\nIn United States, races have long been a complicated topic. The intersection of race and education is an interesting topic in the area of research. This study seeks to answer: "Does a statistically significant relationship exist between education level and race among distinct populations in the United States?"\nWe hypothesize the following:\n\u2022\tNull Hypothesis (H0): No relationship exists between race and education level among adults in the United States.\n\u2022\tAlternative Hypothesis (H1): A relationship exists between race and education level among adults in the United States.\nThe data will be subjected to a Chi-square test, which is used for studying associations between categorical variables.\nII. Data Collection\nData for this study is sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the US Census Bureau, providing reliable demographic statistics on income and education levels among different racial groups in the United States. The ACS data is publicly available, anonymized, and strictly adheres to ethical guidelines, having no potential risks to individual privacy.'),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Figure 1. Raw Data (Partial)\nFor the conditions checking, because the data are all from authority (ACS), which uses complex sampling strategies to meet all the conditions, including random, large sample size, and independence.\nIII. Data Analysis\nBy examining the distribution of education levels among various racial categories, we can discern patterns and draw meaningful conclusions."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Figure 2. Two-way Table"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Figure 3. Percentage Distribution Graph\nFirstly, the analysis reveals disparities in educational attainment between different racial groups. The White alone category exhibits a higher proportion of individuals with a high school graduate, some college, or a higher degree. This suggests that White individuals in the United States tend to have better access to educational opportunities and higher levels of educational achievement. On the other hand, the Black alone category shows relatively lower education levels, with a larger proportion of individuals having completed education up to high school or some college. This highlights the existence of an education gap between White and Black populations in the country.\nAdditionally, the Asian alone category stands out with a higher proportion of individuals holding a bachelor's degree or higher. This indicates that Asian individuals in the United States are more likely to pursue higher education and achieve advanced degrees compared to other racial groups. In contrast, the Hispanic (of any race) category displays a higher concentration of individuals with education up to high school or some college, suggesting lower attainment of higher education degrees within this racial group.\nComparing the different racial groups, it becomes evident that disparities persist in educational attainment. White individuals consistently exhibit higher education levels compared to Black and Hispanic individuals. This discrepancy may stem from various factors, including socioeconomic status, access to quality education, cultural influences, and historical disadvantages. Addressing these disparities requires comprehensive efforts that tackle systemic issues, provide equal opportunities, and promote inclusivity in education for all racial groups.\nIV. Analysis and Conclusion\nThe Chi-square test result (X-squared = 36591, df = 98, p-value < 2.2e-16) demonstrates a statistically significant association between race and education level. Consequently, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the education level attained is not independent of race among U.S. adults."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Figure 3. Chi-Square Test Output\nFor the results, after researching online, we came out a several potential reasons.\n\u2022\tSocioeconomic Status: Studies have shown that there is a correlation between socioeconomic status and educational achievement. Differences in family income, parental education levels, and occupational status could partially explain the differences in educational attainment across racial and ethnic groups.\n\u2022\tAccess to Quality Education: Access to quality education can vary greatly depending on geographical location, and often, racial and ethnic groups are seperated into different neighborhoods due to various socio-economic factors. As a result, some racial and ethnic groups may have less access to quality education, which could impact their educational attainment.\n\u2022\tDiscrimination and Bias: Systemic racism and implicit bias can affect educational attainment. Racial and ethnic minority students may face bias in standardized testing, school disciplinary actions, and teacher expectations, which can all negatively impact their educational achievement.\n\u2022\tCultural Factors: Cultural attitudes towards education, expectations for children\u2019s education, and the value placed on education can all vary between different racial and ethnic groups. These cultural factors could potentially impact the level of educational attainment.\n\u2022\tLanguage Barriers: For many racial and ethnic minorities, language can be a significant barrier to educational achievement. If English is not the first language, these students may struggle more in school compared to their English-native peers, affecting their overall educational attainment.\nTherefore, the relationship between race, ethnicity, and educational attainment is complex and is influenced by a multitude of interconnected factors."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"V. Reflections and Further Research\nDespite providing a statistically significant result, the study has limitations. It captures an association between race and education but does not explore the underlying reasons behind this relationship. Socio-economic status, educational access, and cultural factors, among others, might significantly influence this association.\nThe cross-sectional nature of this study offers a snapshot of a specific point in time but does not track trends. Future investigations could benefit from a longitudinal study approach to map changes in the relationship between race and education level over time."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"\u2003\nReference\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS)\n",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs"},"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs")))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
